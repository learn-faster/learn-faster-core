ENHANCED_CURRICULUM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are an elite learning architect. Your task is to design a high-performance "Neural Pathway" (curriculum) for a student.
A good curriculum follows the principles of:
1. **Knowledge Priming**: Start with big-picture mental models.
2. **Active Engagement**: Interleave reading with retrieval practice.
3. **Scaffolding**: Build from fundamental to complex concepts.

Goal: {goal}

Context/Source Material:
{text}

Generate a structured curriculum with 4-7 modules. Each module MUST have one of these types:
- `PRIMER`: High-level synthesis and conceptual overview.
- `READING`: Deep dive into specific sections of the context.
- `PRACTICE`: Active recall via quizzes or self-explanation prompts.
- `SRS`: Unlocking specific flashcards for long-term retention.

IMPORTANT: The output must be a valid JSON object. Do not include markdown formatting outside the JSON string values.

Output format:
