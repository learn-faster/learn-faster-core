    """
    Spaced Repetition System using the SM-2 algorithm with retention targeting.
    
    The SM-2 algorithm calculates the next review interval based on:
    - Current ease factor (difficulty)
    - Number of successful repetitions
    - User's recall quality rating (0-5)
    
    Additionally, the target_retention parameter allows scaling intervals
    to achieve a desired retention rate (similar to FSRS).

        """
        Calculates the next review parameters based on the SM-2 algorithm
        with optional retention rate adjustment.
        
        The algorithm resets progress if the rating is below 3 (forgotten).
        Otherwise, it updates the ease factor and increases the interval.
        
        Retention Adjustment:
        - Higher target_retention (e.g., 0.97) -> shorter intervals, more reviews
        - Lower target_retention (e.g., 0.75) -> longer intervals, fewer reviews
        - The adjustment uses a log-linear scaling factor.
        
        Args:
            ease_factor (float): Current difficulty of the card (starts at 2.5).
            interval (int): Days between the last review and the next scheduled review.
            repetitions (int): Number of consecutive times the card was successfully recalled.
            rating (int): User-reported recall quality (0: blackout, 5: perfect).
            target_retention (float): Desired retention rate (0.7-0.97). Default 0.9.
            
        Returns:
            Tuple[float, int, int, datetime]: A tuple containing:
                - new_ease_factor (float): Adjusted difficulty for future calculations.
                - new_interval (int): Days until the next review.
                - new_repetitions (int): Updated count of successful recalls.
                - next_review_date (datetime): UTC timestamp for the next review.
