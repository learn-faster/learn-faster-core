# LearnFast Core — Product Overview

## What It Solves
Learning is usually fragmented across notes, videos, and flashcards, with little guidance on **what to do next**. LearnFast Core solves this by turning scattered knowledge into a **goal‑aligned learning system** that:

- Builds durable memory using evidence‑based methods (active recall, spaced repetition, interleaving).
- Connects goals to daily actions and realistic pacing.
- Turns source material into structured study assets (flashcards, curricula, knowledge graphs).
- Tracks progress with actionable analytics instead of vanity metrics.

## What Makes It Different
Most study apps focus on storage or reviews. LearnFast Core combines **ingestion + cognition + goals** into one feedback loop:

- **Goal‑first planning**: Goals drive curricula, daily plans, and pacing — not the other way around.
- **Actionable dashboard**: “What should I do today?” is always clear.
- **Multi‑source intelligence**: PDFs, links, YouTube, and notes become structured learning.
- **Knowledge graphs**: Concepts are mapped so users learn in the right order.
- **Adaptive scheduling**: Uses real performance + (optional) biometrics for better pacing.

## How It Works (High‑Level)
1. **Ingest**: Upload or link content (PDFs, links, YouTube).
2. **Structure**: Extract key sections, filter noise, build graphs and flashcards.
3. **Plan**: Generate goal‑aligned curricula and daily focus plans.
4. **Practice**: Run mixed sessions with spacing + retrieval.
5. **Analyze**: Show retention, velocity, pacing risk, and consistency.
